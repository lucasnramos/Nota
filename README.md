# Nota - Simple Wrapper for Creating and Managing Markdown Notes

I have my notes in Markdown, it's an established filetype, easy to maintain, read and store.

Sometimes I want to quickly create, search or delete some notes, and that's why this exists.

## How to use it?

Don't!! this project is under development and in no way ready for usage.
